                <b>Actually, </b> My experience with computers is not that long.
                I started my journey with HTML; <i>Raw</i> HTML. Afterwards, I got into Python, then started to explore
                many other languages and tools.

                <b>Python, since 2019. </b> Python is the language I learned and tried out the most.
                I am able to utilize Python to build various things, such as file encryptor and emoji image downloader.
                I find Python to be my go-to language, being able to make anything I imagine happen.

                <b>Go, since 2023. </b> Go is the most aesthetic language I've used. My time of using Go is rather short,
                yet I find it easy to learn and create things I desire. I once recreated a Python project
                in Go, and realized it being blazingly fast. To me, Go is the Jack of all trades &mdash; master of <i>all.</i>

                <b>Svelte, since 2024. </b> Svelte might not necessarily be a programming language; but it's no doubt
                an awesome web framework. I've tried React Native, Next.js, and quite a lot of other frameworks, and Svelte is
                the choice of mine. This very website is made with SvelteKit, and I had no issues building the site.

                Although the experience is too little to write it as a paragraph, I think it's worth a mention here.
