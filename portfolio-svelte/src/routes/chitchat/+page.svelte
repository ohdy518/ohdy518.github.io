                Hi, I made this page to write down my thoughts in a better organized way, to practice English,
                to let the future me know what I was up to decades ago, and stuff. If you'd like to know me more,
                this might be a good place. <br />
                <br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
                I'm a developer, perhaps a quasi-developer, who's fascinated by the cultures and the outcomes of the
                developers and its community. I admire the honesty and enlightenment amongst the community, where
                being open-source, helping others, and making the internet a better place for everyone is teeming and considered
                obvious. <br />
                <br />
                As the About me page says, I love anything related to computers. Aside from programming,
                I also have interest in user interface design, hardware technologies, laws and regulations regarding the
                internet, and much more.<br />
                <br />
                I like everything to be organized, unlike my desk setup. I make this website too, to show myself in a more neat
                and organized way. I have some differences in real life and on the internet, one of them being organizing stuff.
                I, in real life, almost never clean my desk. I leave my desk as-is, until it becomes a major health threat.
                On the other hand, digital me likes everything to be organized. Everything in folders, organized and cleaned up
                makes me happy. <br />
                <br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
                I like science, but not all. I like <i>some</i> of the science. I, just like any other man, love explosion,
                fire, shooting and something shattering into smithereens. Playing with the numbers in science is fun.
                You know what's more fun? Playing with numbers to make bigger explosions. If you happen to be one of my friends,
                nitroglycerin as my birthday gift might be worth a consideration (I do not endorse criminal activities). <br />
                <br />
                Explosions aside, I like when I use my software engineering to solve other types of problems. One time,
                I used Python to calculate 20,000+ digits of &pi; (see <a class="hover:underline text-sky-400" href="https://github.com/ohdy518/pi">here</a>).
                The other time, I made a Python TUI to practice English vocabularies for my finals. I own an Arduino Uno lying around,
                and I have no idea where to put it. I'd love to use it <i>somewhere</i>, and I just can't find where it'd be.
