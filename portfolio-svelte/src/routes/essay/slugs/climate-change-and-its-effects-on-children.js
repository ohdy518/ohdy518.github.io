    content: "As the new name 'climate crisis' denotes, climate change has become a major issue in recent years. Although this crisis affects everything on Earth — including humans, plants, and animals — climate change might be critical to some of the aforementioned. Children are one of them. \\dn" +
        "Children, in a broad term, signifies a human being that is still in the phase of physical and emotional development. Children have vital organs and features not fully developed yet. Therefore, ensuring children to grow in a safe and adequate environment is absolutely critical — as the environment would determine how and how well a child would grow. As the Earth has changed in climate, it is also expected to affect the growth of children. Climate changes can be observed, and more importantly, 'felt' in our daily life. Summer getting hotter and hotter, and winter getting colder and colder each year would be a small example. Although the change we feel might be minor, this difference might turn out critical to children. Furthermore, leaving this problem unattended or unresolved would result in even more deviation, eventually shifting to the environment humans struggle to live in. Additionally, climate change might happen alongside environmental pollution, which would affect and hinder the growth of children even further. \\dn" +
        "Climate change is an important problem for everyone — including individuals, organizations, corporates, and governments. It is a burden we made over the past years, and now it is on us to clear it out for future generations. As everyone is able to contribute to solving this issue, it would be important to pay attention, and to act quickly."
