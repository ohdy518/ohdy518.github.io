                Hi, I made this page to write down my thoughts in a better organized way, to practice English,
                to let the future me know what I was up to decades ago, and stuff. If you'd like to know me more,
                this might be the good webpage. <br />
                <br />
                I'm a developer, perhaps a quasi-developer, who's fascinated by the cultures and the outcomes of the
                developers and its community. I admire the honesty and enlightenment amongst the community, where
                being open-source, helping others, and making the internet a better place for everyone is teeming and considered
                obvious. <br />
                <br />
                As the About me page says, I love anything related to computers. Aside from programming,
                I also have interest in user interface design, hardware technologies, laws and regulations regarding the
                internet, and much more.<br />
                <br />
                I like everything to be organized, unlike my desk setup. I make this website too, to show myself in a more neat
                and organized way. I have some differences in real life and on the internet, one of them being organizing stuff.
                I, in real life, almost never clean my desk. I leave my desk as-is, until it becomes a major health threat.
                On the other hand, digital me likes everything to be organized. Everything in folders, organized and cleaned up
                makes me happy. <br />
