                Hi, I made this page to write down my thoughts in a better organized way, to practice English,
                to let the future me know what I was up to decades ago, and stuff. If you'd like to know me more,
                this might be a good place. <br />
                <br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
                I'm a developer, perhaps a quasi-developer, who's fascinated by the cultures and the outcomes of the
                developers and its community. I admire the honesty and enlightenment amongst the community, where
                being open-source, helping others, and making the internet a better place for everyone is teeming and considered
                obvious. <br />
                <br />
                As the About me page says, I love anything related to computers. Aside from programming,
                I also have interest in user interface design, hardware technologies, laws and regulations regarding the
                internet, and much more.<br />
                <br />
                I like everything to be organized, unlike my desk setup. I make this website too, to show myself in a more neat
                and organized way. I have some differences in real life and on the internet, one of them being organizing stuff.
                I, in real life, almost never clean my desk. I leave my desk as-is, until it becomes a major health threat.
                On the other hand, digital me likes everything to be organized. Everything in folders, organized and cleaned up
                makes me happy. <br />
                <br />&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
                Nowadays, at least at the time this paragraph is being written (August of 2024), artificial intelligence
                seems to be taking over the whole internet. Every single corporation &mdash; from computer companies to telecommunication
                services providers &mdash; seems as if they're halting everything they were doing and implementing artificial intelligence for their products.
                AI certainly is not a bad thing, and AI technology advances by competition of many companies.
                However, I believe it has entered the phase of being annoying, rather than being cool or useful. <br />
                <br />
                Everything must hold a valid purpose of existence. In terms of products, its purpose should be focusing
                on the consumers, not the corporation. For example, the iPad collection from Apple holds the purpose of
                satisfying the needs of mobile large-touchscreen tablet device, such as in drawing digital arts. <br />
                <br />
                Some artificial intelligence products hold no purpose for the customers. For instance, win-predicting
                AI for sport games have no benefits of having, and might even make the game unexciting. Even if the AI
                is in the state of the art, purposelessly inserting it into the already good products might make the result
                unappealing as a whole.
